            Few household accidents create as much panic as spilling red wine on a light-colored carpet. That vibrant burgundy splash against beige or cream fibers can seem like a permanent disaster in the making. But before you consider replacing your carpet or rearranging furniture to hide the evidence, take heartâ€”even the most intimidating red wine stains can be successfully treated with the right approach and timely action.

          <h2 className="text-2xl lg:text-3xl font-semibold mb-6">Why Wine Stains Are So Challenging</h2>
          <p>
            Red wine creates such difficult stains because it contains several staining compounds:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Chromogens:</strong> These intensely pigmented compounds give wine its deep color</li>
            <li><strong>Tannins:</strong> Natural dyes that readily bind to fibers</li>
            <li><strong>Anthocyanins:</strong> Water-soluble pigments that penetrate deeply</li>
            <li><strong>Sugars:</strong> These become sticky as they dry, locking pigments in place</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Additionally, the acidic nature of wine helps it penetrate carpet fibers quickly, making immediate action crucial for successful stain removal.

      {/* Emergency Response Section */}
      <section className="bg-white rounded-xl shadow-sm py-10 px-6 lg:py-14 max-w-3xl mx-auto mb-8">
        <div className="prose lg:prose-xl mx-auto">
          <h2 className="text-2xl lg:text-3xl font-semibold mb-6">Emergency Response: The First 5 Minutes</h2>
          <p>
            The moments immediately after a spill are critical. Follow these emergency steps for the best chance of complete removal:
          </p>
          
          <h3 className="mt-6 mb-2 text-xl font-semibold">1. Blot, Don't Rub</h3>
          <p>
            Grab clean, white paper towels or a white cloth and begin blotting immediately. Press down firmly to absorb as much wine as possible. Work from the outside of the stain inward to prevent spreading. Continue with fresh towels until no more wine transfers to the cloth.
          </p>
          
          <div className="bg-red-50 p-6 rounded-lg my-6">
            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-3 text-red-800">Critical Warning</h3>
            <p>
              Never rub the stain! Rubbing damages carpet fibers and drives the stain deeper, making it nearly impossible to remove completely.
            </p>
          </div>
          
          <h3 className="mt-6 mb-2 text-xl font-semibold">2. Apply Cold Water</h3>
          <p>
            Once you've blotted up as much wine as possible, lightly pour a small amount of cold water onto the stain. This dilutes any remaining wine and prevents it from setting. Blot again immediately to remove the diluted wine.
          </p>
          
          <h3 className="mt-6 mb-2 text-xl font-semibold">3. Add Salt</h3>
          <p>
            While the stain is still moist, pour a generous amount of table salt over the entire area. The salt will draw the remaining wine up and out of the carpet fibers. Let it sit until it forms a dry crust (typically 15-20 minutes), then vacuum thoroughly.
          </p>

      {/* DIY Home Solutions Section */}

        <div className="prose lg:prose-xl mx-auto">
          <h2 className="text-2xl lg:text-3xl font-semibold mb-6">DIY Home Solutions for Fresh Wine Stains</h2>
          <p>
            If the emergency response doesn't completely remove the stain, try these household solutions while the stain is still relatively fresh:
          </p>
          
          <h3 className="mt-6 mb-2 text-xl font-semibold">The Baking Soda and Vinegar Method</h3>
          <ol>
            <li>Blot up any remaining moisture</li>
            <li>Mix one part white vinegar with three parts water</li>
            <li>Apply the solution to the stain with a clean cloth</li>
            <li>Blot thoroughly, don't rub</li>
            <li>Sprinkle baking soda over the damp area</li>
            <li>Let sit until completely dry, then vacuum</li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            The vinegar helps neutralize the red and purple pigments, while the baking soda absorbs remaining odors and residue.
          </p>
          
          <h3 className="mt-6 mb-2 text-xl font-semibold">The Club Soda Technique</h3>
          <p>
            Club soda works well on fresh wine stains:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>Blot up excess wine first</li>
            <li>Pour club soda directly onto the stain</li>
            <li>Let it fizz for a minute (the carbonation helps lift the stain)</li>
            <li>Blot thoroughly with clean towels</li>
            <li>Repeat if necessary until no more red color transfers to your cloth</li>
          </ol>
          
          <h3 className="mt-6 mb-2 text-xl font-semibold">The Hydrogen Peroxide + Dish Soap Method (Light-Colored Carpets Only)</h3>
          <div className="bg-yellow-50 p-6 rounded-lg my-6">
            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-3 text-yellow-800">Warning</h3>
            <p>
              This method should only be used on light-colored carpets as hydrogen peroxide has mild bleaching properties.
            </p>
          </div>
          <ol>
            <li>Mix 1/4 cup hydrogen peroxide with 1 tablespoon dish soap</li>
            <li>Apply to the stain with a clean cloth</li>
            <li>Let sit for 5 minutes</li>
            <li>Blot with a clean, damp cloth</li>
            <li>Rinse area with cold water by dabbing with a clean, wet cloth</li>
            <li>Blot dry with clean towels</li>

          <h2 className="text-2xl lg:text-3xl font-semibold mb-6">Commercial Products That Work</h2>
          <p>
            If household methods aren't successful or if you're dealing with a set-in stain, these commercial products can help:
          </p>
          
          <h3 className="mt-6 mb-2 text-xl font-semibold">Wine-Specific Stain Removers</h3>
          <p>
            Several products are formulated specifically for wine stains, including:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Wine Away Red Wine Stain Remover</li>
            <li>Chateau Spill Red Wine Stain Remover</li>
            <li>OxiClean Versatile Stain Remover</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            These products contain enzymes and oxidizers that break down wine's chromogens and tannins.
          </p>
          
          <h3 className="mt-6 mb-2 text-xl font-semibold">Enzyme-Based Cleaners</h3>
          <p>
            Enzyme cleaners break down the proteins in wine stains:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>Blot the stain to remove surface moisture</li>
            <li>Apply the enzyme cleaner according to package directions</li>
            <li>Allow it to work for the recommended time (usually 5-15 minutes)</li>
            <li>Blot with clean, damp cloth</li>
            <li>Repeat if necessary</li>
          </ol>
          
          <h3 className="mt-6 mb-2 text-xl font-semibold">Oxygen Bleach Products</h3>
          <p>
            Products containing sodium percarbonate release oxygen when mixed with water, helping to lift and remove stains without harming carpet fibers.
          </p>

            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-3">CarpetCozy Pro Tip</h3>
            <p>
              Always test any cleaning solution on an inconspicuous area of carpet first to ensure it won't damage the fibers or cause discoloration.

          <h3 className="mt-6 mb-2 text-xl font-semibold">The Steam Method</h3>
          <p>
            Steam helps reactivate dried stains:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>Hold a clothes steamer or steam iron (not touching the carpet) several inches above the stain</li>
            <li>Apply steam for 20-30 seconds to moisten and reactivate the stain</li>
            <li>Blot with a mixture of 1 tablespoon dish soap and 2 cups warm water</li>
            <li>Repeat the steam and blot process until improvement stops</li>
          </ol>
          
          <h3 className="mt-6 mb-2 text-xl font-semibold">The Vinegar and Laundry Detergent Method</h3>
          <ol>
            <li>Mix 1 tablespoon white vinegar, 1 tablespoon liquid laundry detergent, and 2 cups warm water</li>
            <li>Apply to the stain with a clean cloth</li>
            <li>Blot continuously for up to 15 minutes</li>
            <li>Rinse with cold water by blotting with a damp cloth</li>

          <p>
            While many wine stains can be treated at home, there are situations where professional help is your best option:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Valuable or delicate carpets:</strong> Antique, Oriental, or wool carpets require specialized care</li>
            <li><strong>Large or extensive stains:</strong> When wine has affected a large area</li>
            <li><strong>Old, set-in stains:</strong> Stains that have been present for weeks or months</li>
            <li><strong>Failed DIY attempts:</strong> If home methods have made the stain worse or caused damage</li>
            <li><strong>Recurring stains:</strong> If a stain keeps reappearing after cleaning (wicking from padding)</li>
          </ul>
          
          <h3 className="mt-6 mb-2 text-xl font-semibold">What Professional Carpet Cleaners Can Do</h3>

          <p>
            While we can help restore your carpet after a wine spill, prevention is always preferable:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Consider carpet protection:</strong> Professional carpet protectants create a barrier that repels liquids and prevents immediate absorption</li>
            <li><strong>Use coasters and trays:</strong> Place drinks on stable surfaces away from high-traffic areas</li>
            <li><strong>Opt for stemless wine glasses:</strong> These have a lower center of gravity and are less likely to tip</li>
            <li><strong>Keep a wine stain emergency kit:</strong> Assemble clean white cloths, salt, baking soda, and club soda so you're always prepared</li>
            <li><strong>Consider carpet color and material:</strong> When choosing new carpet, darker colors and stain-resistant materials can hide or repel wine stains</li>
          </ul>
