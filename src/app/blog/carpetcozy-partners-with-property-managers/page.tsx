              <h2>Case Study: Complete Property Maintenance</h2>
              <p>
                Recently, a property manager in Granite Bay contacted us about a rental property with multiple maintenance needs. The property had:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>Clogged gutters causing water overflow</li>
                <li>Water-damaged carpets in the basement</li>
                <li>Stained carpets throughout the main living areas</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                By coordinating with Sacramento Gutter Guard, we were able to:
              </p>
              <ol>
                <li>Have Sacramento Gutter Guard clean and repair the gutters</li>
                <li>Install gutter guards to prevent future issues</li>
                <li>Perform water damage restoration on the basement carpets</li>
                <li>Deep clean all carpets throughout the property</li>
              </ol>
              <p>
                The result? The property was ready for new tenants in just three days, with long-term protection against future water damage.
              </p>
