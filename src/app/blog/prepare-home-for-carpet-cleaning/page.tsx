          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Ensures more thorough cleaning of all carpet areas</li>
            <li>Maximizes the efficiency of the cleaning process</li>
            <li>Protects your valuable and fragile items</li>
            <li>Prevents potential accidents or damage</li>
            <li>Allows technicians to focus solely on delivering exceptional cleaning results</li>
          </ul>
          <p>

      {/* Pre-Cleaning Checklist */}
      <section className="bg-white rounded-xl shadow-sm py-10 px-6 lg:py-14 max-w-3xl mx-auto mb-8">
        <div className="prose lg:prose-xl mx-auto">
          <h2 className="text-2xl lg:text-3xl font-semibold mb-6">Your Pre-Cleaning Checklist: 1-2 Days Before</h2>
          
          <h3 className="mt-6 mb-2 text-xl font-semibold">1. Clear Floor Spaces</h3>
          <p>
            Remove small items, toys, shoes, and other objects from all carpeted areas being cleaned. This includes:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Books and magazines</li>
            <li>Children's toys</li>
            <li>Pet toys and accessories</li>
            <li>Shoes and clothing items</li>
            <li>Small decorative objects</li>
            <li>Floor plants and their stands</li>
          </ul>
          
          <h3 className="mt-6 mb-2 text-xl font-semibold">2. Move Lightweight Furniture</h3>
          <p>
            While most carpet cleaning services (including CarpetCozy) will move larger furniture pieces as needed, you can speed up the process by relocating lightweight items such as:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Coffee tables and end tables</li>
            <li>Dining chairs</li>
            <li>Floor lamps</li>
            <li>Small bookcases or storage units</li>
            <li>Footstools and ottomans</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Moving these items to uncarpeted areas or rooms not being cleaned will save time and ensure more thorough carpet coverage.
          </p>
          
          <h3 className="mt-6 mb-2 text-xl font-semibold">3. Identify and Point Out Stains</h3>
          <p>
            Make note of stubborn stains or problem areas that need special attention. Consider:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Making a list of stain locations and types (wine, pet accidents, coffee, etc.)</li>
            <li>Taking photos of concerning areas</li>
            <li>Placing removable sticky notes near hard-to-see stains</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            This preparation ensures technicians can pre-treat these areas appropriately with the right solutions.
          </p>

          <div className="bg-blue-50 p-6 rounded-lg my-6">
            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-3">CarpetCozy Pro Tip</h3>
            <p>
              Avoid using store-bought spot removers right before professional cleaning. Some products can react with professional cleaning solutions. If you have a fresh spill, simply blot (don't rub) with a clean white cloth and water, then let our technicians handle the rest.

          <h2 className="text-2xl lg:text-3xl font-semibold mb-6">On the Day of Cleaning</h2>
          
          <h3 className="mt-6 mb-2 text-xl font-semibold">1. Vacuum Carpets (If Possible)</h3>
          <p>
            While not absolutely necessary (as professional cleaners typically do a preliminary vacuum), giving your carpets a quick vacuum can remove surface debris and allow for deeper cleaning. Focus on high-traffic areas and visible dirt.
          </p>
          
          <h3 className="mt-6 mb-2 text-xl font-semibold">2. Secure Pets</h3>
          <p>
            For the safety and comfort of your pets and our technicians:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Place pets in a secure area away from the cleaning zones</li>
            <li>Consider boarding or arranging for pets to be out of the home</li>
            <li>Ensure pet waste is cleaned up from yards where technicians may need access</li>
          </ul>
          
          <h3 className="mt-6 mb-2 text-xl font-semibold">3. Clear Parking Space</h3>
          <p>
            Reserve a convenient parking spot close to your home's entrance for the cleaning van, which needs to be relatively close to your home for equipment access.
          </p>
          
          <h3 className="mt-6 mb-2 text-xl font-semibold">4. Provide Clear Access</h3>
          <p>
            Ensure there's a clear path to all rooms being cleaned. This includes:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Moving obstacles from hallways and doorways</li>
            <li>Securing low-hanging items that might be damaged by equipment</li>
            <li>Clearing entryway areas where hoses and equipment will be staged</li>
          </ul>

          <h3 className="mt-6 mb-2 text-xl font-semibold">Valuable and Fragile Items</h3>
          <p>
            Before cleaning day, take time to:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Remove valuable items from tables and surfaces that will be moved</li>
            <li>Secure wall hangings and art pieces that could be disturbed by equipment vibration</li>
            <li>Relocate electronics and cords that might be in the way</li>
            <li>Store delicate knickknacks and collectibles safely away from the cleaning area</li>
          </ul>
          
          <h3 className="mt-6 mb-2 text-xl font-semibold">Draperies and Window Treatments</h3>
          <p>
            Pin up or tie back any drapes, curtains, or blinds that hang to the floor to prevent them from getting wet during the cleaning process.
          </p>

          <h3 className="mt-6 mb-2 text-xl font-semibold">Children's Considerations</h3>
          <p>
            If you have young children:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Arrange for children to be out of the home during cleaning if possible</li>
            <li>Move favorite toys to a designated safe area before technicians arrive</li>
            <li>Collect and store small items like LEGO pieces that could be lost or vacuumed up</li>
          </ul>

          <h2 className="text-2xl lg:text-3xl font-semibold mb-6">Making Post-Cleaning Plans</h2>
          <p>
            Professional carpet cleaning typically requires some drying time. To accommodate this:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Plan for 4-8 hours of drying time, depending on carpet type, humidity, and airflow</li>
            <li>Arrange family activities away from freshly cleaned areas</li>
            <li>Consider which rooms you'll need access to immediately and schedule cleaning accordingly</li>
            <li>Prepare alternative sleeping arrangements if bedrooms are being cleaned late in the day</li>
          </ul>

            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-3">CarpetCozy Drying Enhancement</h3>
            <p>
              At CarpetCozy, we use high-powered extraction equipment that removes more moisture during cleaning, resulting in faster drying times. We'll also place air movers in critical areas upon request to further accelerate drying.
