            More households than ever are prioritizing eco-friendly products and services—and for good reason.

          <h2 className="text-2xl lg:text-3xl font-semibold mb-6">Why Choose Eco-Friendly Carpet Cleaning?</h2>
          <p>
            Conventional carpet cleaning products often contain volatile organic compounds (VOCs), phosphates, and other synthetic chemicals that can:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Trigger allergies or asthma symptoms</li>
            <li>Cause skin irritation or respiratory issues</li>
            <li>Leave harmful residues that pets and children may contact directly</li>
            <li>Enter waterways and harm aquatic ecosystems</li>
            <li>Contribute to indoor air pollution</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            By choosing eco-friendly carpet cleaning solutions, you're not only protecting your family's health but also making a positive impact on the environment. Green cleaning methods can be just as effective as traditional methods—sometimes even more so—without the drawbacks.

          <h2 className="text-2xl lg:text-3xl font-semibold mb-6">How CarpetCozy's Green Cleaning Approach Works</h2>
          <p>
            Our eco-friendly carpet cleaning process combines the power of plant-based cleaning agents, advanced equipment, and proven techniques to deliver outstanding results:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Plant-derived cleaning agents</strong> that break down dirt and stains naturally</li>
            <li><strong>Reduced water usage</strong> through efficient equipment design</li>
            <li><strong>Lower-temperature cleaning methods</strong> that save energy while still sanitizing effectively</li>
            <li><strong>Faster drying times</strong> that prevent mold and mildew growth</li>
            <li><strong>No harsh fumes or residues</strong> that could affect sensitive individuals</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            The result is carpets that are genuinely clean—not just masked with fragrances—while maintaining a healthy indoor environment.

        <div className="prose lg:prose-xl mx-auto">
          <h2 className="text-2xl lg:text-3xl font-semibold mb-6">Key Components of Our Eco-Friendly Solutions</h2>
          
          <h3 className="mt-6 mb-2 text-xl font-semibold">1. Plant-Based Cleaning Agents</h3>
          <p>
            Our primary cleaning solutions are derived from plants such as citrus, coconut, and corn. These natural surfactants and solvents effectively break down oils, remove protein-based stains, and eliminate dirt without introducing toxins into your home.
          </p>
          
          <h3 className="mt-6 mb-2 text-xl font-semibold">2. Enzyme Cleaners for Tough Stains</h3>
          <p>
            For challenging biological stains like pet accidents, food spills, or blood, we use specialized enzyme cleaners. These natural proteins break down organic matter at the molecular level, eliminating both stains and odors rather than covering them up.
          </p>
          
          <h3 className="mt-6 mb-2 text-xl font-semibold">3. Steam Extraction with Minimal Additives</h3>
          <p>
            Our hot water extraction method relies more on the physical cleaning power of steam and less on chemical additives. This approach removes more dirt and allergens while minimizing chemical residues in your carpets.
          </p>
          
          <h3 className="mt-6 mb-2 text-xl font-semibold">4. Biodegradable Spot Treatments</h3>
          <p>
            For localized stains, we apply targeted treatments that break down quickly in the environment rather than persisting for years. These spot cleaners are effective on everything from red wine to grease without harsh bleaches or solvents.
          </p>
          
          <h3 className="mt-6 mb-2 text-xl font-semibold">5. Essential Oil Deodorizers</h3>
          <p>
            Instead of synthetic fragrances that mask odors and can trigger allergies, we use essential oils with natural antimicrobial properties that neutralize odors at their source while leaving a subtle, pleasant scent.

          <h2 className="text-2xl lg:text-3xl font-semibold mb-6">Special Benefits for Households with Children</h2>
          <p>
            Children are particularly vulnerable to chemical exposures because:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>They have developing immune and respiratory systems</li>
            <li>They breathe more air relative to their body weight than adults</li>
            <li>They spend more time playing on or near floor surfaces</li>
            <li>They frequently put their hands in their mouths after touching surfaces</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Our eco-friendly approach means parents can feel confident that their children can safely play on freshly cleaned carpets without exposure to harsh chemical residues.

          <h2 className="text-2xl lg:text-3xl font-semibold mb-6">Extra Protection for Pet Owners</h2>
          <p>
            Pets face unique risks from traditional carpet cleaning:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Their bodies are smaller, so chemical exposures have greater impact</li>
            <li>They groom themselves, ingesting any residues on their paws or fur</li>
            <li>They're closer to the floor, breathing in more of any airborne compounds</li>
            <li>Many can't communicate discomfort from irritating substances</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Our pet-safe cleaning process ensures your furry family members aren't exposed to harmful ingredients, while still effectively removing pet stains and odors.

            <li><strong>Club soda for fresh spills:</strong> Blot with club soda to prevent staining</li>
            <li><strong>Steam cleaning with water only:</strong> For light refreshing, some home machines can be used with just hot water</li>
